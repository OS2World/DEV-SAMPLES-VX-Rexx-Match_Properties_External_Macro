 This is a simple macro that will let you match several properties of multiple
objects at one time.  This is similar to the "Match Sizes..." macro that came
with VX-Rexx, except you can match more properties at the same time.

 To install, copy mtchprps.vrm and mtchprps.vrw into your VXREXX\MACROS
directory and add the following line to your profile.vrm file:
        Call VREMacroAdd "Match Properties...", "MtchPrps.VRM"

 Thats it!  Next time you start VX-Rexx, you'll have a new feature!  If you
have any questions or comments, you can e-mail me at:  aabacus@li.net

 You my recieve an error if you try to match an objects property that doesn't
exist.  For instance, if you were to match a MLE with a Button and tried setting
the MLE's caption to be the same as the buttons, then you would get an error
because an MLE doesn't have a caption property.
